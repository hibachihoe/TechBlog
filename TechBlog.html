<h1>"Humans Need Not Apply" </h1>
<div class="blogpost">
	<h2>Welp...I'm over it!</h2>
	<a href="https://hibachihoe.github.io/about_me/aboutme.html">by Gretchen</a>

	<p>I watched this documentary on robots taking human jobs. Jobs that don't require much human labor are being replaced by robot workers. That's all good but now programmers are making robots that can do anything. Even creative work. There's a robot that makes music and there are robots that know how to draw and it's because of humans giving their data by playing free downloadable games. Humans don't even realize that they are the ones teaching these things. Automation is going to happen if we like it or not. It's already happening and humans don't even realize.</p>
	<p>My opinion on this topic is very strong. I think we have to stop robots and I don't know how. It's not like all robots are bad but I feel like the ones that can be kept by humans are the mechanical ones. It's okay to have robots that do manual labor because humans can still have their jobs. I want humans to still have jobs and just have robots that make their job a bit easier but I don't want robots in place of humans. Without jobs our lives are meaningless. What's the point of even living then? This robot world sounds so scary and close to the near future.</p>

	<h2>So they think they can just take our jobs?

	<h3>"Smile While We Snap!"</h3>
	<p>In this section, it explains how pictures can identify people and when purchasing a camera you leave footprints with the serial number on the camera. There are cameras recording you every second. You can even look at what they are filming as just a civilian. In that case, it can just be easier to solve crimes because there is always a camera recording. In my opinion, I feel like this is good because crimes can be solved using video evidence. Video evidence is the best evidence because you can't really get out of trouble when there is visible proof that you're gulity.</p>
	<h3>"The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think"</h3>
	<p>Some parking garages have this system in place where license plates get photographed. So for an example if two cars come at the same time and try to leave at the same time, might not be able to exit because the tickets could be switched. The reason having the sysytem in the first place allows to catch auto thieves and people with big parking bills trying to cheat the system and giving the ticket to the next person. Personally, I feel like there is so many unanswered questions because I feel like this can be improved. Also, the logistics seem too complicated. Like I get they are trying to stop criminals but this is just too much.</p>
	<h3>"You Pay for the Mike, We'll Just Listen In"</h3>
	<p>Phones can be reprogrammed remotely to always have the microphone recording to a separate facility. People can choose to always have it recording. Personally, I feel like this goes against other people's privacy. You may want to record your own conversations but if you're recording other people and they don't know, it's illegal even if you can use it to help situations. You don't want to risk the chance of being sued. I feel that the cons outweigh the pros here.</p>
	<h3> Gretchen's wrap-up </h3>
	<p>Personally, I feel that technology has advanced in numerous ways. I think there needs to be a point though that we stop with the development. It's scary to think that the world will just be technology helping us. We should be capable to do things ourselves. If we don't humans will just become lazy and that's totally not okay.</p>

<h2>An Interview With Bernice Pfluger aka Mom</h3>
<img src="IMG_5198.jpg">
<p> Bernice Pfluger is my mother and she is 49 years young. She currently works at a lawfirm called Ropes & Gray as a creative designer. She majored in graphic design at FIT. She was one of the first people to work on QuarkXPress in 1987 which is basically a software desktop publisher. She wanted me to include that she likes cute animals and she is single.
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> How old were you when you got your first computer?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice">Bernice:</span> Computer. Um. Hmm. I don’t even think I owned by personal computer. I just use the one at work.
</p>
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> What was your favorite piece of technology when you were growing up?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice">Bernice:</span> The Tiger Electronics football game.</p>
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> How has technology changed over your lifetime?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice">Bernice:</span> I think the world is at a much faster pace and information is readily available. But that  also means bad people are closer to use more than ever. I want to say that there 
is bad and good. We have to balance out the bad with good. </p>
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> Have the changes you’ve seen in technology over your lifetime mostly helped or hurt society?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice"
> Bernice:</span> I think it helped society because from now on there will never be an I don’t know to an answer because you can find the answer on the internet. </p>
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> What is your greatest hope for technology in the future?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice">Bernice:</span> I hope technology can actually cure diseases and people will come together. That’s what I at least hope it’s like. </p>
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> What is your greatest fear for technology in the future?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice">Bernice:</span> That people actually stop communicating in person and they only communicate through technology. We will lose human contact. Also, I hope it doesn’t bring us to world war three. </p>
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> What advice would you like to share with the younger generation about technology?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice">Bernice:</span> Always be alert and aware and everything you put out there will stay out there. So think of yourself 20 years from now. Would you like that information to be public?</p>
<p class="gretchen_lines"><span class="gretchen">Gretchen:</span> What is the one thing in technology you wish didn’t exist?</p>
<p class="bernice_lines"><span class="bernice">Bernice:</span> I wish all of those photoshopping apps didn’t exist because when let’s say a teenager looks at a photoshopped model or a celebrity they aspire to be that when in reality it’s fake. The goals are unattainable. I think it makes people feel very insecure about themselves. The people putting out these type of images are also sad. I think people fantasise too much with technology and it’s really only fantasy. Now, people are obsessed with their looks. </p>
